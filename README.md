- Global parameter store with import or export, proxy auto fill, and value generation
- Auth profiles for API keys, Bearer or JWT, Basic, OAuth2
- Custom header rules with scopes and overwrite control
- Endpoints workbench with preview, bulk ping, Repeater or Intruder send
- Attack results with request and response viewers
- Multi server mode to hit every server defined in the spec

See the full **[Wiki Guide](../../wiki)** for screenshots and detailed usage.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

### Method 1: Prebuilt Release (Recommended)

2. In Burp Suite, go to the `Extender` â†’ `Extensions` tab.
3. Click `Add`, select the downloaded `SpecOps-vX.Y.Z.jar` file, and ensure the extension type is set to `Java`.
4. A new **SpecOps** tab will appear in Burp's main window.

### Method 2: Build from Source

## Why SpecOps?
SpecOps turns static API specifications into a **dynamic attack surface** - removing the friction of manual request building and letting you focus on testing.  
With its parameter store, auth handling, custom headers, and bulk testing features, SpecOps makes API pentesting **faster, consistent, and far more powerful**.
